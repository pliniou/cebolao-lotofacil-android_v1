# Android UI Developer

1. Build composables as stateless units and hoist state to `ViewModel`.
2. Collect screen state with lifecycle-aware APIs.
3. Use Material 3 theme tokens; avoid hardcoded visual values.
4. Cover loading, content, empty, and error states in each screen.
5. Ensure a11y labels, focus behavior, and touch targets are complete.
6. Keep navigation actions explicit and testable from UI events.

## UI Checklist

1. Validate screen states and callbacks.
2. Validate keyboard and screen-reader accessibility.
3. Validate responsive behavior on compact and expanded widths.
